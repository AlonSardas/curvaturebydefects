# Curvature design by defects

Simulating molecular dynamics using [HOOMD-blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/) 
to see how the distribution of defects on a lattice changes its Gaussian curvature.

## Installation
To run the code, the following packages must be installed:

```
hoomd
gsd
numpy
matplotlib
